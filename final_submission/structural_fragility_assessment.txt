STRUCTURAL FRAGILITY ASSESSMENT — STAGE 3
================================================================================

Q1: Does targeting increase revenue concentration?
  Full population Top-10% ERPU share: 38.23%
  Targeted set Top-10% ERPU share   : 30.86%
  Stage 1 baseline Top-10% share    : 53.08%
  -> NO: Targeting concentration (30.86%) is below Stage 1 baseline (53.08%)

Q2: Does targeting amplify exposure to extreme users?
  Extreme users (P99 ERPU >= 2,238,980):
    Full population: 44 (1.00%)
    Targeted set   : 44 (3.35%)
  -> YES: Extreme user concentration is 3.3x higher in targeted set

Q3: Is return risk clustered in the targeted set?
  Max single-decile share of targeted: 17.4%
  Top return-risk decile in targeted : 17.4%
  -> Return risk is clustered

Q4: Does small parameter change destabilize solution?
  Tighten return cap (25%→20%): Revenue change = +0.00%
  Tighten conc cap (+15%→+10%): Revenue change = +0.00%
  Both tight: Revenue change = +0.00%
  -> Solution is interior to the feasible region.
     All constraints can tighten by ~5 pp with zero revenue loss.
