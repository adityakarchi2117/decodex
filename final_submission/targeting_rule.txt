FINAL TARGETING RULE
================================================================================

Method: ERPU Ranking with Constraint Feasibility Check
  Penalties set to zero because constraints were satisfied naturally;
  constraints enforced as hard feasibility checks.
  Score_i = ERPU_i (lambda1=0, lambda2=0)

Decision Rule:
  1. Compute ERPU_i = P_cal(purchase_i) * E[freq_i] * E[basket_i] * (1 - return_rate)
  2. Compute risk-adjusted score for each user
  3. Rank users by score descending
  4. Select top 30% = 1314 users
  5. Verify: Return risk ≤ 25%, Concentration Δ ≤ +15%

Threshold Values:
  Min ERPU in targeted set : 346,344
  Min opt_score in targeted: 0.0380
  Mean ERPU (targeted)     : 732,450
  Mean ERPU (non-targeted) : 162,494
