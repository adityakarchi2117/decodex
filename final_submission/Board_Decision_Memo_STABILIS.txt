BOARD DECISION MEMO — CASE STABILIS
Lead Customer Revenue Analytics Advisor | 1 March 2026
================================================================================

The STABILIS customer base underwent a severe structural regime shift between
Year 1 and the shock period. This memo presents the validated targeting
recommendation derived from a three-stage analytical pipeline — baseline
profiling, out-of-sample stress validation, and constrained revenue
optimization — and addresses residual risks the Board should monitor.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. WHAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED AFTER THE REGIME SHIFT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The active customer base contracted by 65%, from 4,068 to 1,423 users. Net
revenue fell 87.2% (1.64 billion to 209 million), and mean ERPU declined
63.5% from 403,242 to 147,097. Crucially, the shock was not uniform: the
return rate improved from 7.79% to 4.82%, and the Gini coefficient compressed
from 0.64 to 0.56, meaning that the surviving customer pool is both less
return-prone and less concentrated than the pre-shock universe. The top-10%
revenue share dropped from 52.0% to 42.2%, indicating that the regime shift
disproportionately eliminated high-spending outliers rather than the broad
middle of the customer base.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. WHAT TRADE-OFFS WERE ACCEPTED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The optimization selects the top 30% of scorable users (1,314 of 4,381) by
risk-adjusted expected revenue. In doing so, it accepts that 3,067 users —
including some with modest positive ERPU — receive no targeting investment.
Stage 2 validation surfaced a Pred-to-Actual ratio of 7.02x and a moderate
overfitting classification (ERPU inflation of 561.8%), which was addressed
through cross-validated isotonic recalibration of Module A probabilities and
per-user Module C basket predictions with Duan smearing and shrinkage toward
the population prior of 109,434. The recalibration reduced but did not
eliminate prediction-level bias; the Board should interpret the 962 million
expected net revenue figure as directionally reliable rather than precise.
Extreme users (P99 ERPU) are 3.3x more concentrated in the targeted set than
in the full population, a deliberate trade-off: these 44 users drive
outsized expected value but also outsized variance.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. WHAT FINAL DECISION IS RECOMMENDED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Target the top 1,314 users ranked by ERPU, defined as calibrated purchase
probability multiplied by expected frequency, per-user expected basket value,
and one minus the training return rate. The minimum ERPU threshold for
inclusion is 346,344; the mean ERPU of the targeted set is 732,450 versus
162,494 for the non-targeted remainder. All three constraints are satisfied
with margin: targeting budget at 30.0% (limit 30%), top-decile return-risk
exposure at 17.4% (limit 25%), and revenue concentration at 30.9%, which is
41.9 percentage points below the Stage 1 baseline of 53.1% — well inside the
permitted +15% ceiling. No penalty terms were required; the solution sits
interior to the feasible region and remains stable when both the return cap
and concentration cap are simultaneously tightened by five percentage points.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. WHAT RISKS REMAIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Three residual risks warrant Board attention. First, 77% of the scorable
universe (3,377 of 4,381 users) recorded no test-period transactions,
meaning the model scores a large dormant segment whose future behavior is
unobserved; if even a moderate fraction reactivates outside the targeted set,
realized revenue capture will underperform expectations. Second, the feature
set carries acknowledged autoregressive leakage — Year 1 frequency is the
dominant predictor of Year 2 frequency — so a further structural break in
purchase cadence would degrade model discrimination. Third, return risk is
clustered: the top return-loss decile within the targeted set absorbs the
full 17.4% return exposure, and any product-mix shift that raises return
rates above the training average of 0.55% would tighten the constraint
toward its 25% ceiling without management visibility until the next
recalibration cycle. The recommendation is implementable today, but the Board
should mandate a quarterly recalibration trigger tied to a ±10% movement in
observed return rates or a ≥15% shift in active-user counts.
